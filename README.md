# Supaheroes Protocol

Supaheroes protocol is a fully decentralized crowdfunding protocol created to be deployable by anyone on any Ethereum network, specifically Polygon. Create crowdfunding campaigns and receive pledges with ease through the smart contract or build your own crowdfunding website/platform and host any projects yourself without worrying about security, ownership, and transparency.

# Status

The protocol is currently under heavy testing and research. We are trying our best to save gas costs and achieve the most loose architecture possible.
